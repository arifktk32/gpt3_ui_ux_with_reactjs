## Introduction
This is the code repository for the web UI/UX project built using React.js. This is my first React.js project created while following along with Adrian (founder & CEO of at [JavaScript Mastery](http://jsmastery.pro/)) in the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F627pKNUCVQ). In this project I've converted a Figma design mockup to a web UI/UX design using React.js, Sass, and HTML.

Learning outcomes of building the project include:

- React Functional components and their reusability
- React file and folder structure
- Fundamental CSS properties to master flex & grid
- Fundamentals of the CSS BEM Model
- Fundamentals of Sass/SCSS (Used by only me, not shown in the tutorial video)
- From soft and pleasant animations to complex gradients
- Perfectly placed media queries for satisfactory responsiveness covering almost devices
- Deploy a React.js website to a server and give it a custom domain name
